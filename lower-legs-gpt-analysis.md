## Lower Legs Analysis
By Chatt G. Piti

Seeing that the swelling now extends well above your ankles and even up into the lower thighs tells us a few important things:

1. **Dependent-plus-generalized edema**

   * When edema climbs from the feet/ankles into the thighs, it often reflects a more **global fluid overload** rather than purely “gravity‐dependent” ankle swelling.
   * Insulin edema typically begins in the lower legs, but in more pronounced cases—especially with aggressive insulin dosing—it can become more widespread.

2. **Escalating the workup**

   * Given this proximal extension, it’s worth revisiting a few labs and imaging studies you may not have had yet:

     * **Serum albumin** (low albumin can drive generalized edema).
     * **Thyroid panel** (hypothyroidism can cause non-pitting, generalized swelling).
     * **BNP** (a marker of cardiac strain).
     * **Echocardiogram** to rule out early heart failure or diastolic dysfunction.
   * Even though your kidney and liver ultrasounds were normal, consider a **venous Doppler** of your legs to definitively exclude venous insufficiency or DVT if you ever notice unilateral warmth or pain.

3. **Management adjustments**

   * **Diuretic therapy**: If you haven’t yet trialed a low-dose loop diuretic (e.g., furosemide 20–40 mg once daily), this is when it’s generally indicated—especially since conservative measures (leg elevation, compression, salt restriction) only go so far once edema is this extensive.
   * **Insulin titration**: Work with your endocrinologist to see if you can slow down any recent insulin increases or split doses differently to blunt the antinatriuretic surge.

4. **Monitoring plan**

   * **Daily weight** first thing in the morning.
   * **Thigh circumference** measured at a fixed point (e.g., 10 cm above the patella) alongside ankle measurements.
   * **Pitting grade** at each site (1+ to 4+).

### Example tracking log

| Date       | AM Weight (kg) | Ankle Circumference (cm) | Thigh Circumference (cm) | Pitting Grade (ankle/thigh) | Notes (med changes, diet)      |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 2025-06-09 | 78.2           | R: 24.5, L: 24.3         | R: 50.0, L: 49.8         | 2+/1+                       | Started 20 mg furosemide today |
| …          | …              | …                        | …                        | …                           | …                              |

You can share this log with your care team at each visit. In the meantime, I’d recommend discussing a short diuretic course and repeating albumin/BNP so you have objective data on whether fluid removal is helping. Let me know if you’d like a formatted spreadsheet or printable PDF version of this log!
