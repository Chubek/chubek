# Introduction \(^o^)/

I'm Chubak. I am a systems and network programmer with interest in AI, automation and graphics. I wish to have a sidegig in electronics that is why I am writing an electronics simulator. I code in C/C++, Go, Rust, Python, Nim, and JS.

This profile serves as a place for all my Github projects, and as a portfolio for potential employers.

# Markdown Codicies and Parchments ヽ(´▽\`)/

My [MDCodices](https://github.com/Chubek/mdcodices) repository serves as a safekeep for all my scribblings about programming and electronics. I call them 'Markdown Codicies & Parchments' because I imagine myself as a 12th century monk and ascribe, or a 10th century Persian polymath, or a -3rd century Greek philosopher, you get the gist, scribbling on a paper for the future scholars to decode.

# Projects by Topic ┬──┬ ¯\_(ツ)

## Eclectic Engineering

### Electronics and Embedded Programming

* [Scheesim](https://github.com/Chubek/Scheesim) -> A WIP electronics circuit simulator written entirely in Rust. As of this moment, the linear an algebraic equation solution systems have been written. Parser is at work. Next is the element stamps. Is it like SPICE? Well, kind of! You be the judge when it's done.

### Math
* [auster-integer](https://github.com/Chubek/auster-integer) [WIP] -> Big Math library. Right now contains implementations for binary operations only.

### Cryptography

* [PoxHash](https://github.com/chubek/PoxHash) -> My very own block hashing algorithm implemented in Go, Rust, Python, Nim, JS, and C.

### Bioinformatics
* [ProteinToCodonTranslator](https://github.com/Chubek/ProteinToCodoneTranslator) and [pn2codon](https://github.com/Chubek/pn2codon) -> Translating Amino Acid PEPs to Dash-Aligned Codons, FFI for Python in Rust.
* [pylibfastcompare](https://github.com/Chubek/pylibfastcompare) -> Lazy Hamming written in C for Python for bioinformatics.
* [pylibfastadedupe](https://github.com/Chubek/pylibfastadedupe) -> Successor to pylibfastcompare (note: one is 'fast'compare one is 'fasta'dedupe.
* [PhyMMR Tools](https://github.com/Chubek/blosum_distance) -> Tools for PhyMMR in Rust. Most of it is done by @mvalentine but I did some stuff too.

### Machine Learning, Auditory and Vision

* [PuertoRECO](https://github.com/Chubek/PuertoRECO) -> Despite the lame pun, this is a very intricate face recognition API. It's in Python so it's not very fast. In the recent months I have decided to do less and less projects in Python because of how slow and inefficient it is. But if you are going to give me a job in Python I will do it. I especially like training using Python and predicting and doing the MLOps in Rust or Go.
* [WillSh3B33](https://github.com/Chubek/will-sh3-b33) -> Basically a backend and a fronted for a model I made. This shows my skills in MLOps. The model itself, it's not very strong but I have learned a lot about training and structuring models since then.
* [Arriv-O-Pred](https://github.com/Chubek/Arriv-O-Pred) -> Basic train time arrival tool which Felix helped me make in my early days. After Tanami, I owe most my professional life to Felix. This man's a behemoth of ML!
* [SongOfSprockets](https://github.com/Chubek/SongOfTheSprockets) -> A voice conversion tool using GMM, a fork of Sprocker-VC with a UI using Dear Imgui.
* [ClickBait Generator](https://github.com/Chubek/clickbait-generator) -> A very simple click-bait generator project.
* [pyramid-anomaly-detection](https://github.com/Chubek/pyramid-anomally-detection) -> Anomaly detection in Python that makes heavy use of vectorization.
* [intresignia](https://github.com/chubek/intresignia) Traffic sign detection.

## Systems and Network

### Web and System Automation
* [Upsc3ne](https://github.com/Chubek/upsc3ne) -> An obscenity detector written in Rust. It's kinda incomplete but already contains implementation for Levenshtein distance and fuzzy string matching.
* [mathcord](https://github.com/Chubek/mathcord) -> My pride and joy. A Discord math bot that includes CUSTOM implementation of Edwards-25519, SHA-512, Shunting Yard and communication with Discord API.
* [potpourri](https://github.com/Chubek/potpourri) -> A webscraper library for Python. Can search Google too. Can do a lot of stuff.
* [CroonJoobGoo](https://github.com/Chubek/CroonJoobGoo) -> A cron job automator written entirely in Go. Right now it only does SQL queries/commands.
* [rusty-bot-swarm](https://github.com/Chubek/rusty-bot-swarm) -> Intricate bot project.
* [Kaibash](https://github.com/Chubek/Kaibash) -> Very WIP Proxy in C
* [ProtoGen](https://github.com/Chubek/Protogen) -> A couple of application-layer potocols in Go. First is ProtoQuore (TCP) and the second is ProtoDir (
UDM). I will add a UDP one soon I just need an idea.
* [Slitherbain](https://github.com/Chubek/Slitherbrain) -> Python code runner in C++. It is WIP but nearly done.

### Networking, Internet, and Web
* [Samovar](https://github.com/Chubek/Samovar) -> A full-fledged Web Framework in Rust that I keep working on until it becomes viable.
* [Mongoose Jumblator](https://github.com/Chubek/mongoose-jumblator) -> A Typescript NPM package that encrypts MongoDB database content.
* [rusty-csv-protcol](https://github.com/Chubek/rusty-csv-protocol) -> A protocol in the application layer of OSI.
* [hmac-tree](https://github.com/chubek/hmac-tree) -> Merkle Trees, but with HMAC! Also contains the implementation of SHA-512 and HMAC besdies MT.
* [rusty-you-dee-pee](https://github.com/chubek/rusty-you-dee-pee) -> UDP implementation in Rust with a TAP/TUN interface, includes implementation of IPv4 too, sends packets without a link layer.
* [FourChidori](https://github.com/Chubek/FourChidori) -> A browser extension for 4chan.
* [HDTP](https://github.com/Chubek/HDTP) -> A WIP application-layer protocol in C. The spec document is not exactly going to be what it's going to be. But it should give you a clear idea. It's almost 40% complete, the lexer/parser is done for config files.


## Graphics Programming and Gaming
* [Expelligraphicus](https://github.com/Chubek/Expelligraphicus) -> Software rasterizer [WIP]
* [Bedlam Noise Apparatus](https://github.com/Chubek/Bedlam-Noise-Apparatus) -> A pretty solid After Effects plugin that generates noise using OpenGL and GLSL. I think it's one of the few FOSS After Effects plugins out there.
