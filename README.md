# Chubak Bidpaa: J'espre

## Introduction

Good day and thank you for opening my Github profile. The document you're seeing before you serves as an introduction to my skills and body of personal projejects that I have done over the years.

A bit about me, I was born in Match 12th, 1993 --- When I was 10, I wanted to be an animator and work for Disney but it proved difficult as family issues piled up --- and when I got my first PC at 12, it did not take long to realize I want to be a software coder. At 16 I thought myself GML and made  [this](http://drive.google.com/uc?id=1tiJwc8e0pNVODyk4CvkTIkNu7SqpwNcR) absolute unit of a game. From there on I marched with the progress of programming technology. I used to code PHP in Notepad++ on Windows and now I code Rust, Go, and C in VSCode on Linux. Besidesa PHP there are several other technologies that I have dropped in favor of better alternatives, chiefly, C# and Java. I have studied Computer Science in college for sometime. I mostly do systems, utilties, network and scripting.

## Stack

* Rust: I use Rust for most of my system, automation, utilities, etc. Although not as perofrmant as C and initially dodgy, Rust now has proven to be a darling. Especially for using it alongside Python using PyO3.
* Go: Using Go for network stuff will take hours off your workload. Go can also be used for simple REPL or terminal utilities. C walks the line between being a scripting language and a systems language and that's surprisingly not a weakness.
* Python: Python handles itself well when you're dealing with large data files, scientific tasks especially, but I can't accept Python in a Pythonic form due to its lack of speed. I will always optimize the Python code first before resorting to using C or Rust as FFI. But alas it often happens that speeding up Python is harder than milking a dead heifer.
* C: I use C only when I need speed and optimization. I'm pretty comfortable with it but I can't simply risk unsafe ramifications when speed and optimization is not intended. C can be used alongside Python's CFFI to create Foreign Function Interfaces for Python in it.
* JS: I do NOT use NodeJS, don't ask me to. I am trying to cease my use of VanillaJS when I need to write a simple HTML form even. I'm trying to bust into WebAssembly and just drop this cumfufle. 
* Kotlin: I have never finished a project in it, but I like it and know it. I don't like Java and if I need something done that requires use of a Java library, Kotlin is of course, the best replacement for Java.
* Nim: I'm just listing this for funzies, it's notwhere near complete to be used in a final project. I like it over Zig. And I am ready to die on this hill.

If you have been directed here from a job board, please have a look at the personal and semi-personal projects that I have done over the years. I have done a lot more projects but they're mostly too old, for example, from 2012 and in C# and useless, or they are propriety and belong to others. If a project is way past its statute of limitation I will permissively list it here.
Please take a thorough look at the following list. You can confirm which language they are in by reading the description. 

Now, can I only do these, and nothing else? Of course I can do most things in programming. I can't program an airlock safety system for the ISS but if your job is not listed here but it somehow pertains to the technology used, I can probably do it.

## Projects

### Machine Learning, Auditory and Vision

* [PuertoRECO](https://github.com/Chubek/PuertoRECO) -> Despite the lame pun, this is a very intricate face recognition API. It's in Python so it's not very fast. In the recent months I have decided to do less and less projects in Python because of how slow and inefficient it is. But if you are going to give me a job in Python I will do it. I especially like training using Python and predictiing and doing the MLOps in Rust or Go.
* [WillSh3B33](https://github.com/Chubek/will-sh3-b33) -> Basically a backend and a frontend for a model I made. This shows my skills in MLOps. The model itself, it's not very strong but I have learend a lot about training and structuring models since then.
* [Arriv-O-Pred](https://github.com/Chubek/Arriv-O-Pred) -> Basic train time arrival tool which Felix helped me make in my early days. After Tanami, I owe most my professional life to Felix. This man's a behemoth of ML!
* [SongOfSprockets](https://github.com/Chubek/SongOfTheSprockets) -> A voice conversion tool using GMM, a fork of Sprocker-VC with a UI using Dear Imgui.
* [ClickBait Generator](https://github.com/Chubek/clickbait-generator) -> A very simple clickbait generator project.
* [pyramid-anomaly-detection](https://github.com/Chubek/pyramid-anomally-detection) -> Anomaly detection in Python that makes heavy use of vectorization.
* [intresignia](https://github.com/chubek/intresignia) Traffic sign detection.

### Automation (System & Web)
* [Upsc3ne](https://github.com/Chubek/upsc3ne) -> An obscenity detector written in Rust. It's kinda incomplete but already contains implementation for Levenshtein distance and fuzzy string matching.
* [mathcord](https://github.com/Chubek/mathcord) -> My pride and joy. A Discord math bot that includes CUSTOM implementation of Edwards-25519, SHA-512, Shunting Yard and communication with Discord API.
* [potpourri](https://github.com/Chubek/potpourri) -> A webscraper library for Python. Can search Google too. Can do a lot of stuff.
* [CroonJoobGoo](https://github.com/Chubek/CroonJoobGoo) -> A cron job automator written entirely in Go. Right now it only does SQL queries/commands.
* [rusty-bot-swarm](https://github.com/Chubek/rusty-bot-swarm) -> Intricate bot project.

### Graphics Programming and Gaming
* [Expelligraphicus](https://github.com/Chubek/Expelligraphicus) -> Software rasterizer [WIP]
* [Bedlam Noise Apparatus](https://github.com/Chubek/Bedlam-Noise-Apparatus) -> Oh BOY I love this one! A pretty solid After Effects plugin that generates noise using OpenGL and GLSL. I think it's one of the few FOSS After Effects plugisn out there. 
* [Rusty Random Pattern Generator](https://github.com/Chubek/rusty-random-pattern-generator) -> A simple pattern generator in Rust.
* [Pong Q-Learning](https://github.com/Chubek/pong-q-learning-nim) -> This is a composite of ML and Game Dev. It uses Reinforcement learning to play Pong. Written in Nim using SDL.
* [cep-panel](https://github.com/Chubek/cep-panel-for-carlo) and its [backend](https://github.com/Chubek/backend-carlo) -> Invisible Adobe Premiere Panel and its backend.
* [NashSmit Renderer](https://github.com/Chubek/NaqshSmith-Renderer) -> A software renderer, it's currently WIP and right now I am just following tutorials to get a foohold in rendering algos. But soon it will spiral into something worthwhile.

### Web, Networking and Internet
* [Samovar](https://github.com/Chubek/Samovar) -> A full-fledged Web Framework in Rust that I keep working on until it becoems viable.
* [Mongoose Jumblator](https://github.com/Chubek/mongoose-jumblator) -> A Typescript NPM package that encrypts MongoDB database content. 
* [rusty-csv-protcol](https://github.com/Chubek/rusty-csv-protocol) -> A protocol in the application layer of OSI.
* [hmac-tree](https://github.com/chubek/hmac-tree) -> Merkle Trees, but with HMAC! Also contains the implementation of SHA-512 and HMAC besdies MT.
* [rusty-you-dee-pee](https://github.com/chubek/rusty-you-dee-pee) -> UDP implementatin in Rust with a TAP/TUN interface, includes implementation of IPv4 too, sends packets without a link layer.
* [FourChidori]([git@github.com:Chubek/FourChidori](https://github.com/Chubek/FourChidori) -> A browser extension for 4chan.
* [HDTP](https://github.com/Chubek/HDTP) -> A WIP application-layer protocol in C. The spec document is not exactly going to be what it's going to be. But it should give you a clear idea. It's almost 40% complete, the lexer/parser is done for config files.

### Math
* [auster-integer](https://github.com/Chubek/auster-integer) [WIP] -> Big Math library. Right now contains implementations for binary operations only.

### Bioinformatics
* [ProteinToCodonTranslator](https://github.com/Chubek/ProteinToCodoneTranslator) -> Translating Amino Acid PEPs to Dash-Aligned Codons.

### Projects I Contribute to
* [Cherry-Node](https://github.com/CherryNetwork/Cherry-Node) -> for my work in Cherry.
