# Chubak Bidpaa: A GentleChud's GentleChud

## Introduction

Good day and thank you for opening my Github profile. The document you're seeing before you serves as an introduction to my skills and body of personal projects that I have done over the years.

A bit about me, I was born in Match 12th, 1993 --- When I was 10, I wanted to be an animator and work for Disney but it proved difficult as family issues piled up --- and when I got my first PC at 12, it did not take long to realize I want to be a software coder. At 16 I thought myself GML and made  [this](http://drive.google.com/uc?id=1tiJwc8e0pNVODyk4CvkTIkNu7SqpwNcR) absolute unit of a game. From there on I marched with the progress of programming technology. I used to code PHP in Notepad++ on Windows and now I code Rust, Go, and C/C++ in VSCode on Linux. However I am trying to make a very bold switch to using Emacs (seethe Vim users! jk both are good) --- However given that I was not born in 1819 it's proving kinda difficult for me. I don't want to waste the client's time and money so I only use it with my personal projects. Besides PHP there are several other technologies that I have dropped in favor of better alternatives, chiefly, C# and Java. I have studied Computer Science in college for sometime. I mostly do systems, utilties, network and scripting.

I am in the process of teaching myself electronics. I have bought a lot of equipment with my ill-gotten opium and arms smuggling money (which I totally do on the side, I am very cool and dangerous) and I am in the process of writing a circuit simulator similar to that of SPICE and CANCER (not kidding it's actually name of a very rudimentary and old circuit simulator) and I don't just wanna do it as a hobby, I wanna design circuits and do embedded programming on the side. If you are kind enough to take a chance on this poor soul's quest to do electronics alongside systems programming do as AssimilateBoozeByAsterisk says and take a chance on me, for poor Violet's sake! Thanks.

## Stack

* Rust: I use Rust for most of my system, automation, utilities, etc. Although not as perofrmant as C and initially dodgy, Rust now has proven to be a darling. Especially for using it alongside Python using PyO3.
* Go: Using Go for network stuff will take hours off your workload. Go can also be used for simple REPL or terminal utilities. Go walks the line between being a scripting language and a systems language and that's surprisingly not a weakness.
* Python: Python handles itself well when you're dealing with large data files, scientific tasks especially, but I can't accept Python in a Pythonic form due to its lack of speed. I will always optimize the Python code first before resorting to using C or Rust as FFI. But alas it often happens that speeding up Python is harder than milking a dead heifer. Python is also very important in scripting. Whenver I am making a Bash script and POSIX-compabability is not an issue, I highly rely on Python to do stuff that Bash cant do. This goes without saying that I am 'kinda' good in Bash as well. It's a necessity for most systems programmers to be proficient in Bourne Shell scripting. I don't wanna advertise it as an skill though. Python, with or without Bash, and Bash, with or without Python or Perl (which sadly I know little about) are the nuclear bomb of any system programmer's arsenal.
* C/C++: I use C/C++ only when I need speed and optimization. I'm pretty comfortable with it but I can't simply risk unsafe ramifications when speed and optimization is not intended. C/C++ can be used alongside Python's CFFI to create Foreign Function Interfaces for Python in it. You may say, well, Chubak,  C (and to some extent C++) are the bedrock of creation and Unix is the Father, Ritiche is the Son, and Karinghan is the Holy Ghost but I was not born a Catholic. I just float along. WHICHEVER SCREWDRIVER SCREWS MY SCREW, I SCREW WITH IT.
* JS: I do NOT use NodeJS, don't ask me to. I am trying to cease my use of VanillaJS when I need to write a simple HTML form even. I'm trying to bust into WebAssembly and just drop this cumfufle. Although you still need JS for WASM. Damn. Will this pain end? I got nothing against JS but I just got no use for it. I doth no protest too much. If JS butters my bread, I dunk it tip-wise. As for any other language I go waiste in.
* Kotlin: I have never finished a project in it, but I like it and know it. I don't like Java and if I need something done that requires use of a Java library, Kotlin is of course, the best replacement for Java.
* Nim: I'm just listing this for funzies, it's notwhere near complete to be used in a final project. I like it over Zig. And I am ready to die on this hill.
* Zig: Zog? I'm just listing the languages I've heard of at this point. Who cares. I can learn a language in a day or two, enough even for a decently sized project. I don't wanna toothe my own horn but I am really, really not bound to 'I know X language' at this point. When you find yourself going knee deep into the assembly of a project, or even programming a microcontroller, you are far beyond the need of 'learning languages'. Now bash my head into a wall for being such insolent lil bee.
* Importance of Debuggers: In any language, I put first and foremost importance on using debuggers as the main tool to debug. And I say that because some people just put print statements from here to yaya. Print-debugging and shotgun-debugging in general is fine if you are in a rush, the codebase is extremely small, and nothing is vital nor fatal about the code working. But for any above medium coding session if you are not going to use a debugger you are going to have a BAD time and I say this, in all honestly, because I as a subscriber to the school of print-debugging myself in the rawness of my youth. May Lord Buddha forgive.

If you have been directed here from a job board, please have a look at the personal and semi-personal projects that I have done over the years. I have done a lot more projects but they're mostly too old, for example, from 2012 and in C# and useless, or they are propriety and belong to others. If a project is way past its statute of limitation I will permissively list it here.
Please take a thorough look at the following list. You can confirm which language they are in by reading the description. 

Now, can I only do these, and nothing else? Of course I can do most things in programming. I can't program an airlock safety system for the ISS but if your job is not listed here but it somehow pertains to the technology used, I can probably do it.

## Projects

### Electronics and Embedded Programming

* [Scheesim](https://github.com/Chubek/Scheesim) -> A WIP electronics circuit simulator written entirely in Rust. As of this moment, the linear an algebratic equation solution systems have been written. Parser is at work. Next is the element stamps. Is it like SPICE? Well, kind of! You be the judge when it's done.


### Machine Learning, Auditory and Vision

* [PuertoRECO](https://github.com/Chubek/PuertoRECO) -> Despite the lame pun, this is a very intricate face recognition API. It's in Python so it's not very fast. In the recent months I have decided to do less and less projects in Python because of how slow and inefficient it is. But if you are going to give me a job in Python I will do it. I especially like training using Python and predictiing and doing the MLOps in Rust or Go.
* [WillSh3B33](https://github.com/Chubek/will-sh3-b33) -> Basically a backend and a frontend for a model I made. This shows my skills in MLOps. The model itself, it's not very strong but I have learend a lot about training and structuring models since then.
* [Arriv-O-Pred](https://github.com/Chubek/Arriv-O-Pred) -> Basic train time arrival tool which Felix helped me make in my early days. After Tanami, I owe most my professional life to Felix. This man's a behemoth of ML!
* [SongOfSprockets](https://github.com/Chubek/SongOfTheSprockets) -> A voice conversion tool using GMM, a fork of Sprocker-VC with a UI using Dear Imgui.
* [ClickBait Generator](https://github.com/Chubek/clickbait-generator) -> A very simple clickbait generator project.
* [pyramid-anomaly-detection](https://github.com/Chubek/pyramid-anomally-detection) -> Anomaly detection in Python that makes heavy use of vectorization.
