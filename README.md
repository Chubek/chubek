# Chubak Bidpaa: Leave the Coding to Me!

## Introduction

Hi! My name is Chubak Bidpaa. I have recently re-discovered my love for gaming. I was born in March 12, 1993 (Esfand 21, 1371). I attended over 6 schools during my time in the lower education because we moved around a lot. I have studied English Literature, French Literautre, and Computer Science in college. 

I got enough CS education at college but college was not my introduction to programming. In fact, I started learning how to program at the young age of 16. The first language I programmed with was GML. I made a Tetris game with it (I lost the source but exectuable can be found [here](http://drive.google.com/uc?id=1tiJwc8e0pNVODyk4CvkTIkNu7SqpwNcR). After that I learned PHP, Perl, Python, and the C#. My current stack is:

* Rust: The language I am most infatuated with, but I seldom find work in. I use it in Cherry though. The entire codebase in Rust and I LOVE it!
* Go: My second most-favorite language. I love it.
* Python: I like Python but it's slow and resource-intensive! However, it's the language I know best.
* JS: I use it often for web projects.
* Kotlin: I have never finished a project in it, but I like it and know it.
* Nim: It's my third most favorite langauge. However, I do not like how experimental and new it is. It's almost raw!

I enjoy doing systems programming, especially systems automation, web automation, machine learning, deep learning and general programming. If you give me a project and tell me "DO IT!" I will find a way to do it. 

I am a somehow-freelancer somehow-employee somehow-contractor with my friend Felix Quinque. I also work with Mr. Herman Jacobs at Cherry. I sometimes collab on projects with my friend Tanami Muller. I also do projects with my friend Emil who is a neuroscientist. 

Over the years I have racked up a cute sum of projects. Let me run you through some of them.

## Projects

### Machine Learning, Auditory and Vision

* [PuertoRECO](https://github.com/Chubek/PuertoRECO) -> Despite the lame pun, this is a very intricate face recognition API. It's in Python so it's not very fast. In the recent months I have decided to do less and less projects in Python because of how slow and inefficient it is. But if you are going to give me a job in Python I will do it. I especially like training using Python and predictiing and doing the MLOps in Rust or Go.
* [WillSh3B33](https://github.com/Chubek/will-sh3-b33) -> Basically a backend and a frontend for a model I made. This shows my skills in MLOps. The model itself, it's not very strong but I have learend a lot about training and structuring models since then.
* [Arriv-O-Pred](https://github.com/Chubek/Arriv-O-Pred) -> Basic train time arrival tool which Felix helped me make in my early days. After Tanami, I owe most my professional life to Felix. This man's a behemoth of ML!
* [SongOfSprockets](https://github.com/Chubek/SongOfTheSprockets) -> A voice conversion tool using GMM, a fork of Sprocker-VC with a UI using Dear Imgui.
* [ClickBait Generator](https://github.com/Chubek/clickbait-generator) -> A very simple clickbait generator project.
* [pyramid-anomaly-detection](https://github.com/Chubek/pyramid-anomally-detection) -> Anomaly detection in Python that makes heavy use of vectorization.
* [intresignia](https://github.com/chubek/intresignia) Traffic sign detection.

### Automation (System & Web)
* [Upsc3ne](https://github.com/Chubek/upsc3ne) -> An obscenity detector written in Rust. It's kinda incomplete but already contains implementation for Levenshtein distance and fuzzy string matching.
* [mathcord](https://github.com/Chubek/mathcord) -> My pride and joy. A Discord math bot that includes CUSTOM implementation of Edwards-25519, SHA-512, Shunting Yard and communication with Discord API.
* [potpourri](https://github.com/Chubek/potpourri) -> A webscraper library for Python. Can search Google too. Can do a lot of stuff.
* [CroonJoobGoo](https://github.com/Chubek/CroonJoobGoo) -> A cron job automator written entirely in Go. Right now it only does SQL queries/commands.
* [rusty-bot-swarm](https://github.com/Chubek/rusty-bot-swarm) -> Intricate bot project.

### Graphics Programming and Gaming
* [Expelligraphicus](https://github.com/Chubek/Expelligraphicus) -> Software rasterizer [WIP]
* [Bedlam Noise Apparatus](https://github.com/Chubek/Bedlam-Noise-Apparatus) -> Oh BOY I love this one! A pretty solid After Effects plugin that generates noise using OpenGL and GLSL. I think it's one of the few FOSS After Effects plugisn out there. 
* [Rusty Random Pattern Generator](https://github.com/Chubek/rusty-random-pattern-generator) -> A simple pattern generator in Rust.
* [Pong Q-Learning](https://github.com/Chubek/pong-q-learning-nim) -> This is a composite of ML and Game Dev. It uses Reinforcement learning to play Pong. Written in Nim using SDL.
* [cep-panel](https://github.com/Chubek/cep-panel-for-carlo) and its [backend](https://github.com/Chubek/backend-carlo) -> Invisible Adobe Premiere Panel and its backend.
* [NashSmit Renderer](https://github.com/Chubek/NaqshSmith-Renderer) -> A software renderer, it's currently WIP and right now I am just following tutorials to get a foohold in rendering algos. But soon it will spiral into something worthwhile.

### Web, Networking and Internet
* [Samovar](https://github.com/Chubek/Samovar) -> A full-fledged Web Framework in Rust that I keep working on until it becoems viable.
* [Mongoose Jumblator](https://github.com/Chubek/mongoose-jumblator) -> A Typescript NPM package that encrypts MongoDB database content. 
* [rusty-csv-protcol](https://github.com/Chubek/rusty-csv-protocol) -> A protocol in the application layer of OSI.
* [hmac-tree](https://github.com/chubek/hmac-tree) -> Merkle Trees, but with HMAC! Also contains the implementation of SHA-512 and HMAC besdies MT.
* [rusty-you-dee-pee](https://github.com/chubek/rusty-you-dee-pee) -> UDP implementatin in Rust with a TAP/TUN interface, includes implementation of IPv4 too, sends packets without a link layer.
* [Peerage](https://github.com/Chubek/Peerage) -> NOTE: Peerage is still EXTREMELY WIP! But I see a good future for it. Basically, it's a P2P network  that relies on only a few utility libraries. I plan on writing everything myself. And I have already put a lot of work on it. I consider Peerage to be more of an experiment than a project.

### Math
* [auster-integer](https://github.com/Chubek/auster-integer) [WIP] -> Big Math library. Right now contains implementations for binary operations only.

### Projects I Contribute to
* [Cherry-Node](https://github.com/CherryNetwork/Cherry-Node) -> for my work in Cherry.
